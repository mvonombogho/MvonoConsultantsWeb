# Website for Mvono Consultants
  This is a serverless website created for Mvono Consultants;an engineering company with the aim of providing it 
  potential clients with detail information on what services they offer and make it easy for them to reach out.

#Project Description
  Technologies used were:
    1. Html
    2. Sass
    3. Vanilla Javascript
    4. Firebase
  I hope in the future to switch from using basic vanilla javascript and refactor the project with React.js 
  and also implement a messaging chatbox using react.js and firebase to enable interactive communication
  with clients.
  
#How to install and run the project
  There is no need to install the project since it is a website. All you need to do is visit mvonoconsultants.com.
  To access this website, all you need is a browser i.e. chrome, firefox, safari.
